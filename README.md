### Starting
We start server by running :<br>
`npm run node_x` where x is in (1..5)

Once the server is up you can interact with it, and access GUI at http://localhost:{port}/block-explorer

### API features
* A proof of work algorithm to secure the network.
* Hashing algorithms to secure the data within the blockchain.
* The ability to mine (create) new blocks that contain data.
* The ability to create transactions and store them in blocks.
* An API/server that will be used to interact with the blockchain from the internet.
* It will be hosted on a decentralized blockchain network.
* A consensus algorithms to verify that the network nodes have valid data and are synchronized.
* A broadcasting system to keep the data in the blockchain network synchronized.
